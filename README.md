### About Me

Hello! I'm Aayush Bhattacharjee, a passionate software developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Application. I thrive on creating innovative solutions that enhance user experiences and solve real-world problems.

Currently, I work as an Associate Software Developer at Warewe Consultancy, where I lead the backend development of a sophisticated application that empowers content creators to manage video series for platforms like YouTube Shorts and TikTok.

With expertise in various programming languages and frameworks, I specialize in fullstack development and have hands-on experience in building scalable applications. My journey has led me to work on exciting projects, from collaborative video-watching platforms to tools that streamline web development processes. 

Skilled in **Golang**, **TypeScript**, **React**, **Python**, **Java** and **Docker**, I enjoy solving complex problems and building tools that make life easier for developers and end-users alike.
